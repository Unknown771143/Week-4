    <p>Hi, I'm the human behind soul.css</p>
    <p>This is a quiet space made from simple code and hope</p>
    <p>It's a project born form curiosity, stress, inspiration, and the need to breath</p>
 

  <div class="reason">
  <h2>Why I made this website</h2>
  <p>I started soul.css as part of a school project where we had to learn something new and document our process.</p>
  <p>I could've learned something easier. But I wanted a challenge. Something real.</p>
  <p>I chose HTML and CSS - two things I didn't know at all.</p>
  <p>I wanted to build a digital space that reflects who I am, what calms me, what inspire me.</p>
  <p>It became more than a project. It became part of my journey.</p>

  <div class="features">
    <h2>What you'll find here</h2>
        <li>focus timer - to help you stay present</li>
        <li>playlists - for some activities</li>
    <p>I'm still learning but I'll try to add more features as much as I can</p>
